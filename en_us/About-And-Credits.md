## About Flat Lights
This started as a small, personal project mod for adding some basic, decorative lights. I did this because I was bored, and you can tell I kept getting bored because I added a bunch of random stuff that wasn't decorative lighting options. Not sure what else to put here but I really felt like the sidebar was empty with only four pages of actual content, so I'm adding stuff to fill in space sorta like a school essay.

Special thanks to Google the search engine, truly the helper of all time for any programmer. Also thanks to [Kaupen Joe's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzPhyLcO8VP25dZ7kaUyAw) YouTube tutorials, as well as [Cy4's Modding](https://www.youtube.com/@cy4) and their tutorial playlists because this was my first time writing a mod for Minecraft and I had no idea where to put stuff (I still don't, but surely it's harder to tell now).

here's a picture of a rat idk
