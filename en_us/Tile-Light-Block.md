_Note: A list of colors can be found [here](Colors)._

A sturdy plated source of light. It comes in the normal 16 dye colors, as well as [hue shifted](Hue-Shifted-Blocks) variants.

## Appearance
Tile light blocks have a small gray square pattern layered on top of the usual colors that are found in the Flat Lights blocks. As it is plated, it lets out less light than the regular [flat light block](Flat-Light-Block) would. The texture is mostly seamless, at least on one side at a time, so it can be used nicely in a floor or wall. 

## Obtaining
Tile light blocks can be crafted using any color flat light block, and 4 iron ingots surrounding the flat light block in a pattern. This will output 8 tile light blocks of the chosen color. Tile light blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
There are currently no crafting uses for tile light blocks.

Tile light blocks are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
