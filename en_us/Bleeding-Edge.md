## Obtaining

Bleeding Edge can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Bleeding Edge is a weapon enchantment that applies a potion effect called [`Bleed`](Bleed) when attacking entities. When hit with a melee attack from a weapon with the Bleeding Edge enchantment, the attacked entity will get `Bleed 1` for 30 seconds. Each following attack will increase the level of `Bleed`, as long as the effect is still active, until it reaches the designated effect cap from the config options. The default cap is 5, so one can reach `Bleed 5` with 5 consecutive hits. If the effect wears off between hits, the attacked entity will start back at `Bleed 1` when hit again.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
