## Obtaining

Bonesaw can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Bonesaw is a weapon enchantment that applies a potion effect called [`Armor Shred`](Armor-Shred) when attacking entities. When hit with a melee attack from a weapon with the Bonesaw enchantment, the attacked entity will get `Armor Shred 1` for 30 seconds. Each following attack will increase the level of `Armor Shred`, as long as the effect is still active, until it reaches the designated effect cap from the config options. The default cap is 5, so one can reach `Armor Shred 5` with 5 consecutive hits. If the effect wears off between hits, the attacked entity will start back at `Armor Shred 1` when hit again.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
