## Appearance
Large tile light blocks have a large gray square pattern layered on top of the usual colors that are found in the Flat Lights blocks. As it is plated, it lets out less light than the regular [flat light block](Flat-Light-Block) would. The texture is mostly seamless, at least on one side at a time, so it can be used nicely in a floor or wall. 

## Obtaining
Large tile light blocks can be crafted using any color flat light block, and 4 iron ingots surrounding the flat light block. This will output 8 large tile light blocks of the chosen color. Large tile light blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
