_A plating machine placed in the world_

## Appearance
The plating machine looks like a white cube with gray side accents, sharing textures with white and gray concrete blocks. The front of the plating machine has a screen texture with orange tints. It also has colored accents similar to the [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block). It has the same block size as any regular block.

## Obtaining
A plating machine is crafted using 2 pistons, 4 white concrete blocks, a [prismatic ingot](Prismatic-Ingot), and 1 redstone dust. This will output a single plating machine block. The plating machine can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The plating machine is used to craft various other items from Flat Lights, and does not take any form of fuel or power to run. The two slots on the left of the GUI are input slots, and the slot on the right is the output item.
