## Obtaining

Flash of Brilliance can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Flash of Brilliance is a weapon enchantment that has a chance of making slain mobs drop extra XP. When a creature is slain and drops XP, there is a base 5% chance of the creature dropping 10 times the XP it would have dropped. For each level of Flash of Brilliance, the chance of getting the bonus XP increases by +5%, so at the max level of 5 there is a 25% chance of getting the 10x XP drop.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
