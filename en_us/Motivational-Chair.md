A comfortable, yet sturdy, chair that a player can sit on.

## Appearance
The motivational chair looks like a white, plastic lawn chair. It takes up the same space as a regular block would, despite the model being slightly taller.

## Obtaining
Motivational chairs can sometimes be found in the loot chests of most generated structures. There is a 40% chance of having 1-4 motivational chairs generate in a chest. Motivational chairs can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
There are currently no crafting uses for motivational chairs.

Motivational chairs are meant to be used as decoration blocks. When a player sits in the chair, the player receives the effects `Regeneration 3` and `Saturation 1`.
