## Appearance
Vertical edge lights have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. They have a light level on par with glowstone blocks or redstone lamps. Vertical edge lights also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect. They can be placed in different orientations and follow along the edges of solid blocks. Also see [horizontal edge lights](Horizontal-Edge-Light) for lights that can be placed horizontally (e.g. along the floor/ceiling, instead of up and down a wall).

## Obtaining
Vertical edge lights can be crafted using 2 of any single color flat light block, placed vertically in a line. This will output 64 vertical edge lights of the chosen color. Horizontal edge lights can also be converted to vertical edge lights at a 1 to 1 ratio. Vertical edge lights can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
