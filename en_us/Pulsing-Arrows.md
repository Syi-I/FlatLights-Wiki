## Obtaining

Pulsing Arrow can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Pulsing Arrows is a bow enchantment that increases the hit radius of fired arrows by a set amount, dealing splash damage to entities near where the arrow hits. The area of effect for fired arrows can be changed in the config options, and by default expands the hit radius of fired arrows by 2 blocks. The percent of damage that splash damage receives from the base arrow's damage can also be changed in the config options, and by default the splash damage is equal to 100% of the fired arrow's damage.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
