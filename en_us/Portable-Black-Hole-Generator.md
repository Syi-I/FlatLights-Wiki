The portable black hole generator is a projectile item that spawns a black hole on impact.

## Obtaining
Portable black hole generators can be crafted using the [Spectralizer](Spectralizer), with 2 netherite ingots, 2 end crystals, 1 nether star, and 1 [prisma nucleus](Prisma-Nucleus). This outputs 1 portable black hole generator. Portable black hole generators can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Right-clicking with a portable black hole generator in the main hand or offhand will throw a portable black hole generator entity in the direction that the player is facing. This projectile entity has similar physics to items such as snowballs or ender pearls, allowing the user to throw somewhat far. Once the portable black hole generator projectile hits a block or entity, it will spawn a black hole entity that sucks any nearby entities towards it. Any entities that touch the black hole will constantly take damage while in contact, taking 1.5 points of [quantum](Damage-Sources#quantum) damage each hit. The black hole entity lasts for 7 seconds before expiring and has a sucking radius of 4 blocks.

There is a cooldown time for using the portable black hole generator, which by default is 10 seconds. The cooldown time can be changed in the config options, as well as the damage done by the black hole and the sucking power of the black hole. The default damage is 1.5 damage per hit, and the default sucking power is 0.2 blocks.
