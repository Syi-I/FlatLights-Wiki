The blackout variants of the various light blocks are identical in functionality, aside from having a lower light level than their non-blackout counterparts.

## Appearance
These blackout blocks look the same as their non-blackout counterparts, except they use models with normal shading instead of no shading. They emit the same light level as a redstone torch.

## Obtaining
Blackout blocks can be crafted shapelessly with any non-plated light block of choice, and blackout powder. Blackout blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The flatblock blackout blocks are also tagged as `flatblock` and can thus be used to craft [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block).

Besides crafting uses, blackout blocks are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
