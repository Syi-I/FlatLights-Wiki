A cheap but sturdy source of light. It shifts between all the colors of the rainbow.

## Appearance
Prismatic blocks have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. They have a light level on par with glowstone or redstone lamps. Prismatic blocks also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect.

## Obtaining
Prismatic blocks can be crafted using any combination of 9 `flatblock`s. This will output 1 prismatic block. Prismatic blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Prismatic blocks can be crafted into [blackout blocks](Blackout-Blocks), or smelted into [prismatic ingots](Prismatic-Ingot).

Besides crafting uses, prismatic blocks are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
