## Obtaining

Quantum Strike can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Quantum Strike is a weapon enchantment that applies a potion effect called [`Entangled`](Entangled) when attacking entities. When hit with a melee attack from a weapon with the Quantum Strike enchantment, the attacked entity will get `Entangled` for 30 seconds, with the level of the `Entangled` effect scaling directly off the level of Quantum Strike (e.g. Quantum Strike 5 applies `Entangled 5`). Hitting a target again will refresh the duration of the effect. Also, when an entity is attacked with a weapon that has Quantum Strike, the entity receives an instance of [quantum](Damage-Sources#quantum) damage equivalent to the attack value of the held weapon.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
