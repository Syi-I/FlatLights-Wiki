_Note: A list of block types can be found [here](Block-Types)._

A sturdy glass block. It is available in the 5 block type patterns, similar to the various plate style blocks.

## Appearance
The different wire glass blocks have a tinted black, translucent appearance. The wire pattern overlays the tinted black, and the patterns are tileable like their plate block counterparts.

## Obtaining
The base flat glass blocks can be crafted using any color glass block, and 8 iron ingots surrounding the glass block. This will output 8 flat glass blocks. The flat glass blocks can then be used to craft the other patterns of wire glass blocks. Those require varying amounts of iron ingots, in the patterns that match their respective light block counterparts. The wire glass blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The flat glass blocks can be used in crafting the other wire glass block variants, but outside of this there are no crafting uses.

Wire glass blocks are meant to be used as decoration blocks.
