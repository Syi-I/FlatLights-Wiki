_The different types of glass blocks_

## Appearance
The different wire glass blocks have a tinted black, translucent appearance. The wire pattern overlays the tinted black, and the patterns are tileable like their plate block counterparts.

## Obtaining
The base flat glass blocks can be crafted using any color glass block, and 8 iron ingots surrounding the glass block. This will output 8 flat glass blocks. The flat glass blocks can then be used to craft the other patterns of wire glass blocks. Those require varying amounts of iron ingots, in the patterns that match their respective light block counterparts. The wire glass blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
