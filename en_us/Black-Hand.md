## Obtaining

Black Hand can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Black Hand is a weapon enchantment that cancels the knockback effect when attacking entities. When hit with a melee attack from a weapon with the Black Hand enchantment, instead of being knocked back the entity will stay in place as if it was never hit.

This enchantment is incompatible with the Knockback enchantment.
