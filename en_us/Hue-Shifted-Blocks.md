The hue shifted variants of the various flat light blocks are identical in functionality, it is just a visual color change.

## Appearance
These hue shifted blocks look the same as their regular, vanilla dye colored counterparts. They have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. Hue shifted flat light blocks emit the same light level as glowstone blocks and redstone lamps. Hue shifted flat light blocks also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect.

## Obtaining
Hue shifted blocks can be crafted using 8 of a single color of flat light block, and a [hue shifting vial](Hue-Shifting-Vial). This outputs 8 of the corresponding hue shifted flat light block. Hue shifted blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The flatblock hue shifted blocks are also tagged as `flatblock` and can thus be used to craft [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block). The hue shifted flat light blocks can also be used to craft the various [shaped](Block-Shapes.md) light blocks, in their corresponding hue shifted colors. Similarly, the hue shifted flat light blocks can also be used to craft the various [plate block](Block-Types.md) light blocks, in their corresponding hue shifted colors.

Besides crafting uses, hue shifted blocks are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
