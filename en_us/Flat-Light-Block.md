## Appearance

## Obtaining
Flat Light blocks can be crafted shapelessly using any block of glass, glowstone dust, and a choice of dye color. This will output 8 Flat Light blocks of the chosen color. Flat Light blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
