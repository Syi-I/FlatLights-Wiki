A cheap but sturdy source of light. It comes in the normal 16 dye colors, as well as [hue shifted](Hue-Shifted-Blocks) variants.

## Appearance
Flat light blocks have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. They have a light level on par with glowstone blocks or redstone lamps. Flat light blocks also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect.

## Obtaining
Flat light blocks can be crafted shapelessly using any block of glass, glowstone dust, and a choice of dye color. This will output 8 flat light blocks of the chosen color. Flat light blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
