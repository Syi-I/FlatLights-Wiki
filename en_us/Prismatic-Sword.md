The prismatic blade is a sword item that can launch an explosive projectile when swung.

## Obtaining
The prismatic sword can be crafted with 1 stick and 2 [prismatic ingots](Prismatic-Ingot) in the typical sword shape. This outputs 1 prismatic sword. The prismatic sword can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The prismatic sword is a weapon that deals damage to entities when the wielder left-clicks. It has a base `6 Attack Damage` and `1.6 Attack Speed`, making it the same strength as an iron sword. The prismatic sword is also able to shoot an explosive projectile in the direction the wielder is facing, if it is swung with a full attack cooldown bar. The explosion does not damage the environment. This ability can be toggled on and off, if the player sneaks and right-clicks at the same time, and by default starts with the ability turned off. The mode of the sword will be indicated in the tooltip of the sword and will also have a notification in the action bar when the mode gets toggled.

As a sword item, the prismatic sword can break some blocks quicker, just like any vanilla sword.

The prismatic sword can be enchanted via an enchanting table, or by combining it with enchanted books in an anvil. It is unbreakable, so it cannot be repaired in an anvil.

The prismatic sword has no crafting uses.
