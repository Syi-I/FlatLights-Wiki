## Description
Health Reduction is a negative potion effect that reduces the amount of max health the player has. Each level of Health Reduction decreases the amount of total health by 20%.

## Sources
Health Reduction can only be applied normally through the [Lethality](Lethality) enchantment, for 30 seconds upon being hit by a weapon with the Lethality enchantment applied to it. The only other source would be using commands.
