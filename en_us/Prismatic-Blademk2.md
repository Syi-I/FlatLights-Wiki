The Final Sunset is a sword item with various weapon modes.

## Obtaining
The Final Sunset can be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command. It is a creative-only item and is not meant to be used.

## Usage
The Final Sunset is a creative-only item. It has 4 weapon modes which can be cycled through by sneaking and right-clicking at the same time, which are `Deactivated`, `Annihilation`, `Black Hole`, and `Spear`. Each mode has a unique function.

| Mode         | Description                                                                                                                              |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deactivated  | When holding right-click, block like when using a shield.                                                                                |
| Annihilation | Deal bonus damage from melee attacks.                                                                                                    |
| Black Hole   | Right-click to shoot a black hole similar to the ones from a [portable black hole generator](Portable-Black-Hole-Generator), but larger. |
| Spear        | Increased attack range. When right-clicking, trigger an attack similar to a riptide trident.                                             |

The Final Sunset has no crafting uses.

## Trivia
I use this item as the initial testing item for new, more complex combat and visual effect ideas, so it has a lot of miscellaneous features. Those features do slowly make their way into normal player accessible items in bits and pieces, such as the secondary damage dealt in the [Quantum Strike](Quantum-Strike) enchantment, extended attack reach, or the entire [portable black hole generator](Portable-Black-Hole-Generator) item. Visual effects like the [Rising Heat](Sets-And-Effects#rising-heat) set effect also come from the Final Sunset's annihilation mode effect.
