A sturdy storage unit block, with expanded capacity in comparison to a regular double chest.

## Appearance
Light storage blocks look like a gray and white cube, sharing textures with gray and white concrete blocks. They also have colored accents similar to the [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block). It has the same block size as any regular block.

## Obtaining
Light storage blocks are created in the [plating machine](Plating-Machine), just requiring a chest and a block of white concrete. This will output a single light storage block. Light storage blocks can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.
