## Appearance
The Mob B' Gone looks like a white cube with gray borders, sharing textures with white and gray concrete blocks. It also has colored accents similar to the [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block). It has about the same block size as a lantern.

## Obtaining
There is currently no crafting recipe for the Mob B' Gone, as the block is not implemented. The Mob B' Gone can be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The Mob B' Gone is a block that prevents hostile mobs from spawning in the same chunk the block is placed in. Spoiler alert it doesn't actually do anything yet, but you can use it as decoration in creative mode if you want.

The Mob B' Gone has no uses in crafting.
