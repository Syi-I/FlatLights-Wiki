## Obtaining

Lethality can be obtained normally from the enchantment table. It is not a treasure enchantment, and can also be acquired through trading with villagers as well as from generated loot in structures.

## Usage

Lethality is a weapon enchantment that applies a potion effect called [`Health Reduction`](Health-Reduction) when attacking entities. When hit with a melee attack from a weapon with the Lethality enchantment, the attacked entity will get `Health Reduction 1` for 30 seconds. Hitting a target again will refresh the duration of the effect.

This enchantment is compatible with all other enchantments.
