Reusable dyes are dye colors that are not consumed when crafting.

## Obtaining
Reusable dyes can be crafted shapelessly with 1 of any dye color of choice, and 1 glass bottle. All reusable dye colors can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Reusable dyes are crafting ingredients that can be used like regular vanilla dyes. They are not consumed when crafting, similarly to buckets with fluids leaving the bucket behind when used.

The reusable dyes are also tagged as their corresponding forge dye colors and can thus be used to craft in place of normal dyes for most things.
