_**Direct Damage:** Applied directly by the attacker, attacker is the direct source of damage.     
**Indirect Damage:** Applied from some projectile, spawned entity, potion effect, etc., will eventually lead back to the original cause as the source of damage and counts for player kills if the original source was a player's action._

## Bleed
Applied through the [Bleeding Edge](Bleeding-Edge) enchantment's [`Bleed`](Bleed) effect, it causes indirect damage to the affected entity.

## Entangled
Applied through the [Quantum Strike](Quantum-Strike) enchantment's [`Entangled`](Entangled) effect. It can be applied directly through the expiration of the `Entangled` potion effect, as well as the area of effect damage that the `Entangled` potion effect applies. It can be indirectly applied from the [Erosion Aura](Sets-And-Effects#erosion-aura) set effect.

## Physical
Directly applied through the [Neutralizer](Neutralizer) enchantment's conversion effect. It can be indirectly applied through the bonus damage from the [prismatic blade](Prismatic-Blade), and the [Pulsing Arrows](Pulsing-Arrows) enchantment's splash damage.

## Quantum
Applied indirectly through the [Quantum Strike](Quantum-Strike) enchantment's on-hit effect, as well as when standing and taking damage from a black hole spawned via a [portable black hole generator](Portable-Black-Hole-Generator).
