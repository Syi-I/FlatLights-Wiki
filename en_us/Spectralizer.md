_A Spectralizer placed in the world_

## Appearance
The Spectralizer looks like a white cube with gray side vents, sharing textures with white and gray concrete blocks. The front of the Spectralizer has a screen texture with colored bars. It also has colored accents similar to the [prismatic blocks](Prismatic-Block). It has the same block size as any regular block.

## Obtaining
A Spectralizer is crafted using 3 of any glass block, 4 white concrete blocks, a [prismatic ingot](Prismatic-Ingot), and 1 redstone dust. This will output a single Spectralizer. The Spectralizer can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
The Spectralizer is used to craft various other items from Flat Lights, and does not take any form of fuel or power to run. The six outer slots are input slots, and the center slot is the output item.
