A cheap but sturdy source of light. It comes in the normal 16 dye colors, as well as [hue shifted](Hue-Shifted-Blocks) variants. It can be placed in different orientations and can be water logged.

## Appearance
Horizontal edge lights have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. They have a light level on par with glowstone or redstone lamps. Horizontal edge lights also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect. They can be placed in different orientations and follow along the edges of solid blocks. Also see [vertical edge lights](Vertical-Edge-Light) for lights that can be placed vertically (e.g. up and down a wall, instead of along the floor/ceiling).

## Obtaining
Horizontal edge lights can be crafted using 2 of any single color flat light block, placed horizontally in a line. This will output 64 horizontal edge lights of the chosen color. Vertical edge lights can also be converted to horizontal edge lights at a 1 to 1 ratio. Horizontal edge lights can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Horizontal edge lights can be used in crafting as [blackout blocks](Blackout-Blocks).


Besides crafting uses, horizontal edge lights are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
