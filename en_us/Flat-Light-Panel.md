A cheap but sturdy source of light. It comes in the normal 16 dye colors, as well as [hue shifted](Hue-Shifted-Blocks) variants. It can be placed in different orientations and can be water logged.

## Appearance
Flat light panels have entirely flat textures, with no borders or noise, which gives the blocks a seamless look when used together. They have a light level on par with glowstone blocks or redstone lamps. Flat light panels also make use of a model that has no shading, giving them an interesting visual effect. They can be placed in different orientations, which allows them to cover an entire block's surface when using 6 panels.

## Obtaining
Flat light panels can be crafted using 3 of any single color flat light block, placed horizontally in a line. This will output 24 flat light panels of the chosen color. Flat light panels can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Flat light panels can be used in crafting as [blackout blocks](Blackout-Blocks).


Besides crafting uses, flat light panels are meant to be used as decoration blocks for lighting.
