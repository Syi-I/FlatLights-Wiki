## Obtaining
Extinguishing fire has a chance to drop 1 Jogoat item. This chance can be changed in the config options, but by default is a 1% drop chance. Jogoat can also be found in the `Flat Lights` creative tab, or obtained through the `/give` command.

## Usage
Acquiring a Jogoat item triggers a hidden achievement, `[Stand proud, you're strong.]`. 

Jogoat has no crafting uses.
